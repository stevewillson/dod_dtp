# dod_dtp

Software to enable requirements of AR 600-85.

From AR 600-85:

## 4â€“20. Drug-Testing Program software 
All Army units are required to use the DOD-developed Drug Testing Computer Program as their predominant method for selecting Soldiers for random testing and preparing the required testing forms and labels. Units should submit at least 95 percent of their urinalysis specimens using the DOD DTP software.

- DOD DTP Software
- Current Unit Roster (Excel document with columns: 'First Name', 'Last Name', EDIPI, Rank, 'Unit Assigned')

Overall design of the software:

## Drug-Testing Program
The DOD DTP is software designed to manage and automate a unit-level substance abuse program. The UPL uses the software to maintain a list of personnel in the unit, randomly select Soldiers for drug testing, and print required forms and bottle labels. CSPs may also use the DOD DTP for managing civilian drug testing.
